Martha (Hayley Atwell) and Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) are a young couple moving into a secluded home in the countryside. 
Ash is a social networking addict and constantly checks his phone to see if there are updates on his social networking pages. 
The day after moving to the new house, Ash dies in a car accident while going to return the rental van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah 
(Sinead Matthews) talks about a new online service that allows people to stay in touch with the dead.
By using all your previous conversations online and their profiles in social networks, a new "Ash" can be created in a virtual way. 
Martha absolutely rejects the idea, but Sarah inscribes Martha in the service anyway, without telling her. 
When Martha receives an email supposedly from Ash, she gets angry with Sarah, who asks her to at least try it before dismissing it.

<h2>Should we have an opinion, a belief or knowledge about limits of technology? Why?<h2/> 

<p>
in my opinion actually the humans controlled the technology but in a future for example in the famous series black mirror  
the persons use the technology for although things in my episode for example the love of a couple that the men dead and his 
boyfriend buy a system that use all the information of his  social networks and create his personality and  she began to think that
there was no death and in the pass of weeks she buy a clon of his boyfriend them she thought that this is not your boyfriend is a machine.
I think that the feelings of a woman that lost his boyfriends cause a type of sadness that produce the feeling controlled the intelligence and cause bad  decisions
, i think that the technology helps the humans but not in all for example a robot that is your boyfriend is crazy because the machine don't have feelings.

<h2>Do you think that technology improves or inhibits our knowledge tools and skills? Why?<h2/>
<p>
I think that the technology helps the humans ,the technology does not  limit the capacity of the people because the humans create 
the machines to do the life more easy is a source of knowledge and helps to enter to places that the human don't enter for example the
space and to create parts to the human body and helps incapacitated people but if some people tell the humans can be a androids because 
the technology cause that a lot of things are easy and it helps the global warming and the contamination, finally I think that the technology 
in the future helps the planet and the humans.

<p>
this image represent the easy use of the interned and the facility to acquire it, actually all the people have internet and cellphones 
, in the past the philosophers don't  have anything to do and for this reasons think and now a lot of things and in the actually the people 
all the time use the internet, in my opinion the internet actually limits our time and cause that the human dont think anything and create new ideas, 
it is clear that are persons that create new ideas but this limits the society because cause that the people think that only the professionals create 
new ideas and objects.
