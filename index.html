		<h2>IÂ´ll be right back<h2/>

		<p>

Martha (Hayley Atwell) and Ash (Domhnall Gleeson) are a young couple moving into a secluded home in the countryside. 
Ash is a social networking addict and constantly checks his phone to see if there are updates on his social networking pages. 
The day after moving to the new house, Ash dies in a car accident while going to return the rental van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah 
(Sinead Matthews) talks about a new online service that allows people to stay in touch with the dead.
By using all your previous conversations online and their profiles in social networks, a new "Ash" can be created in a virtual way. 
Martha absolutely rejects the idea, but Sarah inscribes Martha in the service anyway, without telling her. 
When Martha receives an email supposedly from Ash, she gets angry with Sarah, who asks her to at least try it before dismissing it.
